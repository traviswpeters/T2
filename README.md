#T^2

##Description
======

Pronounced "T-Squared"

If you are anything like me, you love playing on the command line! A lot of my work has me on the command line 
the majority of the day, but I'm one of those weird people that loves formating my output in the terminal. 

Once thing I almost always want to be able to do is create stylized headers for code that is about to run. 
This is how I came up with the idea for T^2 (Terminal Text or just TermText). 

Now, when my hefty programs run at the command line, I have some fun output to introduce the project, 
myself, or anything I want really!

The code is super simple, easily extendable, and free to any and all who might want to try it out!

Let me know if you have any ideas to improve the code or if you have any questions.
